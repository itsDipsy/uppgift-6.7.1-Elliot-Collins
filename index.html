            <h2>About the Air Nation</h2>
            <p>
                Air Nomads is the collective term for the monastic order of men and women who practice the discipline of
                airbending and the pacifistic ethics of their theocratic society. One of the four nations, the Air
                Nomads were wanderers by definition, but had four air temples, one located at each corner of the globe,
                found atop mountain ranges and under cliffs, in the northern Earth Kingdom and on three remote islands,
                all of which were hard for outsiders to reach. Unlike the other nations, those born to the Air Nomads
                were, without any seen exception, all benders due to the high level of spirituality of their people.
            </p>
            <h2>Air Bending</h2>
            <p>
                Airbending, one of the four elemental bending arts, is the aerokinetic ability to control and manipulate
                air. The peaceful Air Nomads utilized this type of bending in their everyday lives.
                Air is the element of freedom. The Air Nomads detached themselves from worldly problems and concerns;
                finding peace and freedom was the key to solving their difficulties in life. Airbenders continually
                sought spiritual enlightenment, and, as a result, all children born into the Air Nomads were benders.
                The first airbenders learned their art from the flying bison.
